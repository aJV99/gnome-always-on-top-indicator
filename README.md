GNOME Shell extension that draws a coloured border around windows set as always-on-top.

https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8561/always-on-top-indicator/

> Maintained fork of [perosredo/gnome-always-on-top-indicator](https://github.com/perosredo/gnome-always-on-top-indicator).

## Features

- Visible border on any window you toggle to always-on-top
- Configurable border thickness (0.25–10 px)
- Lives in the preferences dialog — no config files to touch

## Installation

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aJV99/gnome-always-on-top-indicator.git
cd gnome-always-on-top-indicator
make install
```

Restart GNOME Shell (`Alt+F2`, then `r`) on X11, or log out and back in on Wayland. Then enable the extension:

```bash
gnome-extensions enable always-on-top-indicator@sredojevic.ca
```

…or toggle it on in the **Extensions** app.

### Uninstall

```bash
make uninstall
```

## Requirements

- GNOME Shell 45–48
- Wayland or X11

## Roadmap

This fork is actively adopting the upstream project, fixing known bugs, and targeting a new release on extensions.gnome.org. Progress is tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### Phase 0 — Housekeeping ✅
- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `Makefile`
- Untrack generated build artifacts

### Phase 1 — Correctness fixes
- Stop borders from leaking across workspaces
- Collapse duplicate per-window bookkeeping
- Allow dialog and utility windows, not only normal ones
- Remove unused imports and misleading identifiers

### Phase 2 — Features
- Real GNOME accent-color integration (GNOME 47+)
- Configurable colour, opacity, and corner radius
- Move inline styles into a proper stylesheet

### Phase 3 — Bundled default keybinding
- Ship `Super+Ctrl+T` as a default always-on-top shortcut so non-technical users don't need to run `gsettings` manually
- Rebindable from the preferences page

### Phase 4 — Internationalisation
- `po/` scaffolding and translator-friendly build targets

### Phase 5 — CI and release pipeline
- GitHub Actions: pack the extension, validate schemas, attach the artifact on tagged releases

### Phase 6 — GNOME Extensions submission
- New UUID owned by this fork
- Submit to extensions.gnome.org
